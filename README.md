### Computers in Earth Science

Computers are essential to all modern Earth Science research.  We use them for compiling and analyzing data, preparing illustrations like maps or data plots, writing  manuscripts, and so on.  In this class, you will learn to write computer programs with special applications useful to Earth Scientists.  We will learn Python, an object-oriented programming language, and use Jupyter notebooks to write our Python programs.



### Python

#### Why Python?

- Flexible, freely available, cross platform;

- Easier to learn than many other languages;

- It has many numerical, statistical and visualization packages;

- It is well supported and has lots of online documentation.

The name 'Python' refers to 'Monty Python' - not the snake - and many examples in the Python documentation use jokes from the old Monty Python skits.  If you have never heard of Monty Python, look it up on youtube; you are in for a treat. 

#### Which Python?  

- The notebooks in this repository are compatible with Python 3.6+. While most of the notebooks are compatible with Python 2.7, we do not test or maintain backwards compatibility.   



### Jupyter notebooks

This course is entirely structured around a special programming environment called [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). A Jupyter notebook is a development environment where you can write, debug, and execute your python programs. It is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Jupyter notebooks do not have to *exist, or be run on your computer*, they can be created and run on a *remote machine* in which you *access* them via a web browser (e.g. Firefox, Safari, IE, Chrome). Hence you do not even need to install Python on your computer.



### Lecture synposis 

A complete table of contents for this course can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hpc4geo/Python-for-Earth-Science-Students/blob/main/_TableOfContents.ipynb).

Note that the view above is read-only - you will not be able to execute or modify the notebooks.

If you wish to explore the lectures interactively, you can access them via Binder by clicking [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hpc4geo/Python-for-Earth-Science-Students/main), or by clicking the "launch Binder" button at the top of this ReadMe file.



### Getting started

The simplest way to begin is by clicking the "launch Binder" button at the top of this ReadMe file. This "one-click" option will launch your personal Jupyter environment for this course.

Once you have launched the Jupyter notebook environment, open the file `Lecture_01.ipynb`.
