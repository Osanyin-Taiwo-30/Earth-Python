### Computers in Earth Science

Computers are essential to all modern Earth Science research.  We use them for compiling and analyzing data, preparing illustrations like maps or data plots, writing  manuscripts, and so on.  In this class, you will learn to write computer programs with special applications useful to Earth Scientists.  We will learn Python, an object-oriented programming language, and use Jupyter notebooks to write our Python programs.



### Python

So, why learn Python?  Because it is:

- Flexible, freely available, cross platform;

- Easier to learn than many other languages;

- It has many numerical, statistical and visualization packages;

- It is well supported and has lots of online documentation.

The name 'Python' refers to 'Monty Python' - not the snake - and many examples in the Python documentation use jokes from the old Monty Python skits.  If you have never heard of Monty Python, look it up on youtube; you are in for a treat. 

##### Which Python?  

- The notebooks in this repository are compatible with Python 3.6+. While most of the notebooks are compatible with Python 2.7, we do not test or maintain backwards compatibility.   
- If you decide to use a personal computer, we recommend that you install the most recent version of Anaconda python for your operating system: 
https://www.anaconda.com/download/
you will also need a few extra packages (cartopy, version 0.17.0,  geoplots, geopandas and a few others) which can be installed with little hassle.  



### Jupyter notebooks

This course is entirely structured around a special programming environment called [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). A Jupyter notebook is a development environment where you can write, debug, and execute your python programs.  

Clone or download this repository and launch the Jupyter notebook environment. 

To do this, you will need to discover the hidden secret of your computer, the _terminal window_ (or Anaconda Prompt on a PC).  This little window provides a _command line interface_ in which you can type commands to the operating system. You  can  find the terminal window through the program `Terminal` on a Mac  by typing terminal.app into the search icon.  If you double click on it, it will open a terminal window.  To find it on a PC search for the program anaconda.

Once you have launched the jupyter notebook browser, navigate to your course directory and open `Lecture_01.ipynb`.
