    "#### Variable Naming Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variable names are composed of alpha-numeric characters (A-z, 0-9) and the underscore ('\\_') character.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python (and thus variable names) are case sensitive: 'a' is not the same as 'A'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore. A variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There are some _reserved keywords_ in Python (Python 3.6 defines 33 reserved keywords) that you are not allowed to use as a variable names because they have pre-defined meanings (for example,  `False` or `True`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of reserved words: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "False    def     if       raise\n",
    "None     del     import   return\n",
    "True     elif    in       try\n",
    "and      else    is       while\n",
    "as       except  lambda   with\n",
    "assert   finally nonlocal yield\n",
    "break    for     not\n",
    "class    from    or\n",
    "continue global  pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable Naming Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of leeway in choosing variable names in Python, but there are some guidelines and \"best practices\". \n",
    "Here are some tips about variable names:  \n",
    "\n",
    "_1. Do not use a variable which matches the name of built-in Python function._\n",
    "\n",
    "The language will let you do it, but it will come back to haunt you later with an expected error.\n",
    "Below are some commonly-used Python functions which you should avoid as variable names:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "abs()    all()     any()    array() ascii()\n",
    "bool()   complex() dir()    eval()  exec()\n",
    "filter() float()   format() help()  id() \n",
    "input()  int()     len()    map()   max() \n",
    "min()    next()    object() pow()   print()\n",
    "open()   range()   set()    slice() sum() \n",
    "super()  type()    vars()\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should also avoid all names defined in commonly-used Python code libraries like: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "acos() asin()  atan() exp()\n",
    "fabs() floor() log()  log10()\n",
    "sin()  cos()   tan()  sqrt()\n",
    "pi e\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "_2. Use expressive words_ \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, longer more descriptive (expressive) words are better because they'll remind you what the variable stores (i.e. represents). \n",
    "\n",
    "_3. Utilize the Python standard for naming \"things\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python community has a well established set of \"best practices\" for variable names, documented here\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning these guideline (and adhering to them) will help you to more rapidly ingest Python code written by other people. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some popular choices recommended:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use these lower case options for variables:\n",
    "- `lowercase`  \n",
    "- `lower_case_with_underscores`  \n",
    "- `mixedCase` \n",
    "\n",
    "Use these upper case options for constants:\n",
    "- `UPPERCASE`  \n",
    "- `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`\n",
    "\n",
    "Other options:\n",
    "- `CapitalizedWords` (or CapWords, or CamelCase -- so named because of the bumpy look of its letters). This is also sometimes known as StudlyCaps. - this style should be used for _classes_ which we will learn about later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores`: Please do not use this style it is hard to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final pieces of advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names. These are easily confused in some fonts with '1' (one), '0' (zero), for example.  If you really want a letter 'el', use 'L'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use non-standard symbols like $^{\\circ}$ or $\\sim$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Be careful with special names that use leading or trailing underscores.  these are treated differently by Python and you have to know what you are doing before you use them.  "
