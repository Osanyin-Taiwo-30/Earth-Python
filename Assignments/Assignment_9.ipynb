    "`ax.plot_surface()` and `ax.contour3D()` *in the same plot*. Make the surface transparent via the `alpha` argument and set its color to grey or black. Plot 20 evenly spaced contours from the range $z = [0, 3500]$ m. Color the contours using the color map created by `dem_utils.create_topo_cmap()`. Add a color bar to your plot, label the axis and include the units of all physical quantities.\n",
    "4. In part 3, it is likely the result is hard to interpret due to the high frequency variations of the topography. For the purpose of visualization, it is sometimes desirable to smooth the data a little - just for the sake of making a nicer picture. One way to do that is using Gaussian blurring. To apply Gaussian blur use the code snippet shown below. This code will process `z_2d` and return a blurred version `z_2d_b`. Re-do part 3 using `z_2d_b` and compare the results.\n",
