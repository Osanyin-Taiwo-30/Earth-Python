    "\n",
    "- Read the data file `Datasets/ClayMinerals/clay_meta_data_v1.csv` into a pandas `DataFrame`.\n",
    "- These are data for the clay minerals in different types of soil from Ito & Wagai 2017 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5667577/ ).\n",
    "- Use `.groupby()` to group the datasets by \"Soil order\" and \"Topsoil or Subsoil\". You can group by more than one column. \n",
    "- Use the `mean()` method to get the mean value for each type of clay for the topsoil and subsoil for each soil type.\n",
    "- Make a plot with 2 columns and 4 rows.\n",
    "- The `.groupby()` method has a method `.agg()` which takes a dictionary of the desired column headers (in this case the minerals) as keys and what action is required (in this case 'mean') as values. `.groupby()` also can make plots specifying the kind of plot, the `ax` object, the rotation of the xlabel (use `rot=0` in the following) and the title (use the soil type in the following).\n",
    "- Choose four soil types. For each soil type, plot a bar chart of the topsoil minerals in the left hand column and a bar chart of the subsoil minerals in the right hand column. For each chart, get rid of the minerals for which the abundance is 0.\n",
    "- Set the plot title to the type of soil (\"Topsoil or Subsoil\").\n",

    "### 2. Plotting histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the file `Datasets/SurfaceTemp/surfaceTemperature.txt`, you will find global surface temperature data that was recorded by the MODIS satellite.\n",
    "- Inspect the data.\n",
    "- Import the surface temperature data from `surfaceTemperature.txt` into a pandas `DataFrame`.\n",
    "- Sort the data.\n",
    "- Plot the global surface temperature across the globe as a histogram. Plot the mean, median and mode as vertical lines and add a legend. Note that the `mode()` method works a little differently than the other to and you have to turn the result into a `float`. Do these statistics tell us much for this dataset?\n",
    "- Generate a cumulative distribution function of temperature across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Convergence of the mean\n",
    "- Create a simulated normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "- Using a `for` loop, create a program that draws a value from the distribution and appends it to a `list`. Do this until your list is 100 values long.\n",
    "- At each loop of the list, calculate the mean of the values that you have drawn so far. Append the mean to another list.\n",
    "- Plot the mean of each draw against number of points in the draw as a line plot. Add a red horizontal line at 0.\n",
    "- How many points does it take for the mean to reasonably approximate an answer of 0?"
