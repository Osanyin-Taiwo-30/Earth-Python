    "In 1600, William Gilbert hypothesized that the Earth itself was a giant bar magnetic and that this gave rise to the Earth's **magnetic field**!  If it were true- that the source of the magnetic field behaved like a giant bar magnet- then the **inclination** of the **magnetic field** would vary as a function of latitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inclination** is the angle between the horizontal and the direction of the field.   If the field were generated by a bar magnet, then the **inclination** would be horizontal (0 $^\\circ$) at the magnetic equator and vertical ($\\pm 90 ^\\circ$) at the North and South poles. The equation that relates **inclination** ($I$) and **latitude** ($\\lambda$) is:\n",
