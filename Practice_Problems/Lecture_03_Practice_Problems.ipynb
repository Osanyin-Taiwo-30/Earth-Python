    "1.  Conceptual \n",
    "     - Give an example of when you would  use a `set`.\n",
    "     - Give an example of when you would use a `tuple`.\n",
    "     -  Give an example of when you would use `range()`. \n",
    "2.  Lists\n",
    "     -  Create an empty list called `oceans`.\n",
    "     -  Append all the oceans to the list.  \n",
    "     -  Print the ocean at **index** 3 in the list.\n",
    "     -  Print the last element of your list. \n",
    "     -  Make a shallow copy of `oceans` called `seas` and a deep copy of `oceans` called  `big_water`. Try to modify the copies. Verify that the shallow copy refers to the same underlying object while the deep copy makes an independent object.  \n",
    "     -  Apply the method `.sort()` to one of your copies and then print the copy.\n",
    "3. The `range()` function\n",
    "     -  Use the function `range()` to create a list with a  “range” of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 100, increment by any number (less than 100) and print the results.\n",
    "4. Tuples\n",
    "     -  Create a tuple called `continents` with the continents as elements.\n",
    "     -  Attempt to change the second **element** (not index) in place (this should throw an error). \n",
    "     -  Print out the third **element** (not index)  in the tuple.\n",
    "5. Sets\n",
    "     -  Create a set from the `oceans` list you created earlier.\n",
    "     -  Print out the set of oceans."
